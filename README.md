# Openwater Generation 1 Bloodflow Analysis

## Overview

The Openwater Blood Flow Analysis Device is an innovative diagnostic tool designed to non-invasively measure and monitor cerebral blood flow. Utilizing advanced near-infrared light techniques, it facilitates the detection of hemodynamic changes associated with various medical conditions, particularly cerebrovascular events like strokes.

The Openwater Blood Flow Application repository is a comprehensive suite containing source code for the Gen1 Blood Flow Analysis Software, including the vision application itself, DSP kernel for real-time image data processing, User Interface, and Python modules for data analysis and visualization.
